Classes and Javascript

We'll look at class orientation as a design pattern. Afterwards, we'll examine the mechanics of

We'll also look at how these class concepts don't work that well with object mechanisms in Javascript.
Although the concepts don't work well, there have been many patterns to overcome those challenges.

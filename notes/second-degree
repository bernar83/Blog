There are many ways to become a software developer. 

How I decided to pursue a career in software development

People come from different backgrounds to become one.

1. Self-Taught
Pros: 
- Flexibility: on your time, learn anything, don't have to stick to a curriculum
- In contrast to a degree you don't have to take classes that don't pertain to what you want to learn
- A lot of the things you want to learn are free or not expensive

Cons:
- Don't have the credentials to back yourself up 
- Not having a curriculum to follow and may seem lost
- May take longer when not knowing what exactly to take 

2. Coding Bootcamps
Pros:
- Come out with a lot of knowledge in a short amount of time 
- Being with people who also want to be developers
- Have mentors 
- Depending on the bootcamp you have connections 
- Depending on the bootcamp they'll help you find a job 
- Cost is a little pricey depending on where you go the cost is way cheaper than a typical four year education
- Gives you a curriculum to follow 
- Gives you projects to show off
- Depending on the bootcamp you'll learn relevant skills
- Depending on the bootcamp you'll have resume reviews 
- You'll have mock interviews
- They'll also teach you algorithms and data structures for the interview and on the job

Cons:
- Bootcamps can be pretty expensive depending on where you're at financially (Seen $20k)
- You may learn out of date technologies
- Quality of learning could be bad
- You may not be job ready and still have to learn more for what kind of job you want
- The pace is fast and you can suddenly fall behind
- Require a lot of hours

3. College
Pros:
- You are learning the foundation to build upon 
- If going to a four year degree program full time, you get the time to focus on programming and take classes you want
- You learn how to learn
- Getting a degree gives you more validation to get hired 
- It'll never hinder you from getting that job
- Nothing beats a college education 
- Quality of learning is the best
- Work with like minded people
- Depending on the degree you'll be a better developer because of it

Cons:
- Way too much loans
- You learn something you won't need
- Takes 4 years
- You can't just expect a job with no experience or side projects

Why I choose college 
- I want the education and love it. I don't have to worry about competing with other CS grads. It won't hurt me. 
- The education I found isn't expensive
- Degree is flexible
- Degree is what I want and won't teach me something I won't need
- I still get to work on projects I want to work on because of the Flexibility
- Going back to school defers my current loans

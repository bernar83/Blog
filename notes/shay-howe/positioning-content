-Essentially, the float property allows us to take an element, remove it from the normal flow of a page, 
and position it to the left or right of its parent element.
-Ex: An <img> element floated to the side of a few paragraphs of text, for example, 
will allow the paragraphs to wrap around the image as necessary.
-When we float an element, we take it out of the normal flow of the HTML document. This causes 
the width of that element to default to the width of the content within it. Sometimes, such as 
when we’re creating columns for a reusable layout, this behavior is not desired. It can be 
corrected by adding a fixed width property value to each column. Additionally, to prevent 
floated elements from touching one another, causing the content of one to sit directly next to 
the content of the other, we can use the margin property to create space between elements.
When floating an element, it is also important to recognize that an element is removed from the normal 
flow of a page, and that may change an element’s default display value. The float property relies on 
an element having a display value of block, and may alter an element’s default display value if it is 
not already displayed as a block-level element.
-Floats: The left value will clear left floats, while the right value will clear right floats. The both value, however, will clear both left and right floats and is often the most ideal value. It is important that this clear be applied to an element appearing after the floated elements, not before, to return the page to its normal flow.
-Rather than clearing floats, another option is to contain the floats. The outcomes of containing floats versus those of clearing them are nearly the same; however, containing floats does help to ensure that all of our styles will be rendered properly.
-To contain floats, the floated elements must reside within a parent element. The parent element will act as a container, leaving the flow of the document completely normal outside of it.
-(*zoom: 1;) Gets older browsers to play nicely with floats.
Ex: 
  group {
  clear: both;
  *zoom: 1;
}

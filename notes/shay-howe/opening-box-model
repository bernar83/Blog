-Set width and height for block or inline-block elements
-Inline elements don't accept width and height properties
-Margins used for space around borders of elements
-Inline elements don't accept top and bottom margins 
-Padding provides spacing inside of an element 
-Padding properties work work vertically on inline elements
-Vertical padding may bleed into lines above and below an element
-Setting unique properties for margins/paddings the shorthand version starts top to left clockwise
-To set value for top/bottom and left/right use two values, first for top/bottom and second for left/right
-Longhand properties are single properties that accept one value 
-Borders can be set by shorthand (border: 6px solid #949599) or longhand (border-width, border-style, 
    border-color)
-Borders can be split into individual side with own properties (border-left: 6px solid #949599 
    or border-bottom-width: 12px)
-Border radius allows us to round borders 
-Border radius: A single value will round all four corners of an element equally; two values 
    will round the top-left/bottom-right and top-right/bottom-left corners in that order; 
    four values will round the top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left corners in that order.
-box-sizing property can change how the box model works. The three values are content-box, padding-box, and border-box
    *content-box: default for keeping the additive design (vendor prefixes are used for older browsers. 
    Support different properties and values)
    *padding-box: deprecated in CSS3
    *border-box: border and padding are added into calculations with width. If an element has a width of 400 pixels, 
    a padding of 20 pixels around every side, and a border of 10 pixels around every side, the actual width will remain 400 pixels.
    If we add a margin, those values will need to be added to calculate the full box size. Generally speaking, the best box-sizing 
    value to use is border-box. The only drawback to using the box-sizing property is that as part of the CSS3 specification, 
    it isnâ€™t supported in every browser; it especially lacks support in older browsers.

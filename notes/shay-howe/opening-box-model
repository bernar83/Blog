-Set width and height for block or inline-block elements
-Inline elements don't accept width and height properties
-Margins used for space around borders of elements
-Inline elements don't accept top and bottom margins 
-Padding provides spacing inside of an element 
-Padding properties work work vertically on inline elements
-Vertical padding may bleed into lines above and below an element
-Setting unique properties for margins/paddings the shorthand version starts top to left clockwise
-To set value for top/bottom and left/right use two values, first for top/bottom and second for left/right
-Longhand properties are single properties that accept one value 
-Borders can be set by shorthand (border: 6px solid #949599) or longhand (border-width, border-style, 
    border-color)
-Borders can be split into individual side with own properties (border-left: 6px solid #949599 
    or border-bottom-width: 12px)
-Border radius allows us to round borders 
-Border radius: A single value will round all four corners of an element equally; two values 
    will round the top-left/bottom-right and top-right/bottom-left corners in that order; 
    four values will round the top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left corners in that order.
